#NumberToText

### Approach
* Based on the discussion we had in the interview, I understood that ASP.Net with Razor syntax is heavily used in our project.
* Hence, it was a clear choice for me to choose ASP.Net for this assessment even if I didn't work on it before.
* The solution I am providing for this problem statement is quite optimized and with the scope of making it generic.
* For this assessment, I am limiting the amount to be inserted to be less than 100,000. But this can be extended to any level with minimal changes to the code.
